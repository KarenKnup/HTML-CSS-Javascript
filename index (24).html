<!-- 4 Ways to DECLARE a JavaScript VARIABLE:
      * Using var
      * Using let ~~ If you think the value of the variable can change, use let
      * Using const ~~ If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const ~~ nÃ£o podem mudar
      * Using nothing
---------------------------------------------------
IDENTIFIERS - All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. Identifiers are case-sensitive.
These unique names are called identifiers.
     * Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
     * Names must begin with a letter.
     * Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
     * Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
     * Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
---------------------------------------------------
ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR (=) - The Assignment Operator
In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:
      x = x + 5
---------------------------------------------------
DATA TYPES - JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".
In programming, text values are called text strings.
JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.
Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.
      const pi = 3.14;
      let person = "John Doe";
      let answer = 'Yes I am!';
---------------------------------------------------
DECLARING A VARIABLE - Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword:

      var carName;     or:    let carName;
After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is UNDEFINED).

To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign:
      carName = "Volvo";
You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it:
      let carName = "Volvo";

It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.

Example:
      let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
       or
      let person = "John Doe",
      carName = "Volvo",
      price = 200;

Example:
      var carName = "Volvo";
      var carName;
If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value. Will appear "Volvo".
You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.

---------------------------------------------------
ARITHMETIC

Example:
    <script>
    let x = 5 + 2 + 3;
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    </script>

Example: string
    <script>
    let x = "John" + " " + "Doe";
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    </script>

OBS: If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
    let x = "5" + 2 + 3;  == 523

    <script>
    let x = 2 + 3 + "5"; == 55
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    </script>
---------------------------------------------------
DOLLAR SIGN ($) - Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names:

    <script>
    let $$$ = 2;
    let $myMoney = 5;
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = $$$ + $myMoney; == 7
    </script>

Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, but professional programmers often use it as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript library.

In the JavaScript library jQuery, for instance, the main function $ is used to select HTML elements. In jQuery $("p"); means "select all p elements".

---------------------------------------------------
UNDERSCORE (_) - Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names:

<script>
let _x = 2;
let _100 = 5;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = _x + _100; == 7
</script>

Using the underscore is not very common in JavaScript, but a convention among professional programmers is to use it as an alias for "private (hidden)" variables.
--------------------------------------------------
Create a variable called z, assign x + y to it, and display the result in an alert box.

var x = 5;
var y = 10;
var z = x + y;
alert (z);
----------------------------------------------------
let length = 16;    // Number

let lastName = "Johnson"; // String

const x = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
};       //Object

  <!-- VAR -->
  <p>In this example, x, y, and z are variables.</p>
  <p id="demo"></p>
  <script>
  var x = 5;
  var y = 6;
  var z = x + y;
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
  "The value of z is: " +z;

  <!-- LET -->
   <p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The value of z is: " + z;

  <script>
  x = 5;
  y = 6;
  z = x + y;
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
  "The value of z is: " + z;
  </script>

  <!-- CONST -->
  <p id="demo"></p>
  <script>
  const price1 = 5;
  const price2 = 6;
  let total = price1 + price2;
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
  "The total is: " + total;
  </script> 
  <!-- The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword.
These are constant values and cannot be changed.

The variable total is declared with the let keyword.
This is a value that can be changed.-->

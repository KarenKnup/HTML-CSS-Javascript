  Objeto - Carro

All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.

All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

  <h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
// Create and display a variable:
let car = "Fiat";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = car;
</script>

  <!-- Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to a variable named car:
  The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.-->
<script>
// Create an object:
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

// Display some data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "The car type is " + car.type;
</script>

  <!-- You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal: -->
  <script>
// Create an object:
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

// Display some data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>

  <!-- Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines: -->
  <script>
// Create an object:
const person = {
  firstName: "John", 
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

// Display some data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>

  <!-- The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:
    firstName (Property) ---- John(Property Value) 
  
  You can access object properties in two ways:
      objectName.propertyName
            or
      objectName["propertyName"]
  JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties.
-->
  <script>
// Create an object:
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id     :  5566
};

// Display some data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;
</script>

  <script>
// Create an object:
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id     :  5566
};

// Display some data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
person["firstName"] + " " + person["lastName"];
</script>

  <!-- Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.
  fullName(Property)----function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}(Property value) -->
  <script>
    const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id       : 5566,
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};
  </script>
 <!-- In the example above, this refers to the person object.
I.E. this.firstName means the firstName property of this.
I.E. this.firstName means the firstName property of person. 
  
  Accessing Object Methods
You access an object method with the following syntax:
  objectName.methodName()
        or
  name = person.fullName(); -->
  <script>
// Create an object:
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  id: 5566,
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

// Display data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person.fullName();
</script>

  <!-- Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects!
When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object:

x = new String();        // Declares x as a String object
y = new Number();        // Declares y as a Number object
z = new Boolean();       // Declares z as a Boolean object
Avoid String, Number, and Boolean objects. They complicate your code and slow down execution speed. 
  
  
  const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
};
alert(person.firstName);-->

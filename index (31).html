<!-- HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.
  
  Here are some examples of HTML events:
An HTML web page has finished loading
An HTML input field was changed
An HTML button was clicked
  
  With single quotes:
<element event='some JavaScript'>
  
With double quotes:
<element event="some JavaScript">

  Here is a list of some common HTML events:
onchange -	An HTML element has been changed
onclick	- The user clicks an HTML element
onmouseover	- The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
onmouseout	- The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
onkeydown	- The user pushes a keyboard key
onload -	The browser has finished loading the page

<body>
  <!-- In the following example, an onclick attribute (with code), is added to a <button> element: -->
  <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML=Date()">The time is?</button>

<p id="demo"></p>
  <!-- In the example above, the JavaScript code changes the content of the element with id="demo".
In the next example, the code changes the content of its own element (using this.innerHTML):-->
  <button onclick="this.innerHTML=Date()">The time is?</button>
  
<!-- JavaScript code is often several lines long. It is more common to see event attributes calling functions: -->
  <button onclick="displayDate()">The time is?</button>

<script>
function displayDate() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = Date();
}
</script>

  <!--
<button onclick="alert('Hello')">Click me.</button>

  The <div> element should turn red when someone moves the mouse over it:
 <div onmouseover="this.style.backgroundColor='red'">myDIV.</div>
 -->
